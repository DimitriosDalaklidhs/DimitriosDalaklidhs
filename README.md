# Dimitrios Dalaklidis
Informatics student at the University of Western Macedonia, graduating with 192 ECTS. I work primarily in C and Java, with a focus on systems programming, network applications, and backend development. I am comfortable at the low level: sockets, process management, memory, file I/O. I also have experience building production-structured backend applications with REST APIs, JWT security, and database backends.
Open to junior roles in systems, backend, or software engineering.

## Projects
**[Greek Hospital Management Spring Boot REST API](https://github.com/DimitriosDalaklidhs/spring-boot-Greek-hospital-system)** `Java` `Spring Boot` `MySQL` `JWT` `Docker` `Kubernetes`
Secure REST API for managing hospital patients, hospitalizations, and medical tests. Features stateless JWT authentication, role-based access control (DOCTOR / CLERK / ADMIN) enforced at the HTTP method level, and atomic patient registration via Spring `@Transactional`. Includes a full Luhn algorithm implementation for validating Greek ΑΜΚΑ numbers with birth-date extraction. Containerized with Docker and deployed on Kubernetes.

**[Library-System-Java-MySQL](https://github.com/DimitriosDalaklidhs/Library-System-Java-MySQL)** `Java` `MySQL`
Full library management system with SWING and MySQL backend. Features user authentication, book search, borrowed-book tracking, and automated database initialization via SQL schemas.

**[process-supervisor](https://github.com/DimitriosDalaklidhs/process-supervisor)** `Bash` `Docker`
Lightweight process supervisor written in Bash for managing and auto-restarting long-running workloads in Docker and Kubernetes environments.

**[tcp-prime-factors-server-client](https://github.com/DimitriosDalaklidhs/tcp-prime-factors-server-client)** `C`
TCP client-server application. The client sends integers over a socket; the server computes and returns their prime factors. Built for a networking course at UoWM.

**[GitProjectServer](https://github.com/DimitriosDalaklidhs/GitProjectServer)** `C` `Winsock`
Multithreaded HTTP server written from scratch using Windows sockets. Handles concurrent connections without a framework.

**[currency-exchange-server](https://github.com/DimitriosDalaklidhs/currency-exchange-server)** `C`
TCP/IP client-server system for currency exchange operations. Focuses on protocol design and socket communication.

**[unix-process-management](https://github.com/DimitriosDalaklidhs/unix-process-management)** `C` `Unix`
Demonstrates the Unix process lifecycle: creation, child execution, and synchronization using `fork()`, `getpid()`, and `wait()`.
