# Dimitrios Dalaklidis

Informatics student at the University of Western Macedonia, graduating with 192 ECTS. I work primarily in C and Java, with a focus on systems programming, network applications, and backend development. I am comfortable at the low level: sockets, process management, memory, file I/O. I also have experience building full-stack applications with database backends.

Open to junior roles in systems, backend, or software engineering.
